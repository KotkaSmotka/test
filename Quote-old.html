		<a href="">Shawn Wang thinks</a> there are deeper, perhaps more uncomfortable, places to go with developer experience (DX) beyond the surface-level stuff <a href="">that we recently covered.</a> Sure, sure, documentation, CLIs, good demos. But there are <i>much</i> harder questions to answer that are part of the real DX. Shawn lists eight really good ones. I’ll share this one:

		<blockquote>
			<i>No product launches feature complete. Nobody expects you to. <strong>The true test is whether you address it up front or hide it like a dirty secret.</strong> As developers explore your offering, they will find things they want, that you don’t have, and will tell you about it. How long do you make developers dig to find known holes in your product? Do developers have confidence you will ship or reject these features promptly, or are they for a “v2” that will never come?</i>

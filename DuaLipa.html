			A few months ago Dua Lipa announced that her second album, “Future Nostalgia” was going to come out early. <q>I hope it brings you some happiness,</q> she says.
		</p>

		<p>
			In a review of Lady Gaga’s comeback single, <i>Stupid Love</i>, which was released in February, a critic wrote that the song filled <q>a void in our downcast landscape</q>, adding that the only other artist like Gaga right now is the British pop star Lipa. Her music, the review said, is <q>big, bright, heart-on-sleeve. There’s an appetite for this kind of exuberant sound</q>.

			Lipa, when she hears about the Gaga review, looks delighted, if shocked, and even a little daunted. The comparison between the two singers makes sense, though. Lipa’s eponymous debut album won her Grammys and buoyed millions with its sassy, indefatigable resilience. Fast-forward to newly released “Future Nostalgia”, and she is aiming for even greater heights. Like Gaga’s at its best, it is music for endorphins, designed to never make you sad.

		<p>
			<q>For me,</q> Lipa says, <q>there should always be some sort of a happy ending.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			I met the 24-year-old artist earlier this year, before the Covid-19 pandemic got serious, when people still thought nothing about meeting face-to-face. After bumping elbows, we sat down for tea at a banquette in a London club.

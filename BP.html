<h2>Blackpink with Selena Gomez, ‘Ice Cream’</h2>

<!---<video></video> --->

The sweet spot at the intersection of Selena Gomez and the K-pop stars Blackpink involves a kind of singing that’s a little playful, a little taunting, a little distant. “Ice Cream” is all of those things, a relentlessly bouncy and chipper song about being the object of other peoples’ hunger.

	<h2>Cam’ron, <a href="">‘ … 50 bars … ’ Freestyle</a></h2>

	Some al fresco rapping from Cam’ron — still a mercilessly precise rapper at 44 — filmed in a Harlem parking lot, prompted by a friend’s nudging and posted on Instagram. The rhymes are spry and wry: “Y’all know Harlem belong to me/I don’t want it, it’s too gentrified/I’m from the era of genocide, bodies are unidentified, alibis are memorized.” CARAMANICA
